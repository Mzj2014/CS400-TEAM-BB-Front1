Dewdrops rolling in the bright early morning. Nothing is more beautiful than sunlight. 
Taking a deep breath and walking along the mountain road, we feel the comfort of nature.(Zijing)
Soon after, a bear passed in front of me, and I held my breadth. The bear walked up to me and 
took a deep breath.(Shutong Lin)
The bear sniffed me, and I wasn't sure whether I should run or stay still. My heart was racing, but eventually
it walked by. (Gabe Alexander)
